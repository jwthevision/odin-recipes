<h1>Description</h1>
<p>These shortbread cookies consist of a shortbread crust, a firm caramel center, and a mild chocolate top. They are super-easy to make and they only take 20 minutes to bake. Some users may find that lowering the intensity of the heat when making the caramel will result in a much easier time than making the caramel as the recipe calls for. However, I say <strong><em>follow these directions at your own risk.</em></strong></p>
<p>Some users feel that dark chocolate makes for a better option than milk chocolate due to the milk chocolate making the finished product too sweet. I believe the bittersweet chocolate makes for a delicious substitute. Some steps are not the most defined when it comes to methodology when it comes to how long to cool the shortbread before adding the caramel and chocolate, but paying attention to reviewer's experiences will lead to a clear indication of best practices when attemting this dish.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2/3 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
    <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together 2/3 cup butter, white sugar, and flour until evenly crumbly. Press into a 9 inch square baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes</li>
    <li>In a 2 quart saucepan, combine 1/2 cup butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and sweetened condensed milk. Bring to a boil. Continue to boil for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon for about 3 minutes. Pour over baked crust (warm or cool). Cool until it begins to firm.</li>
    <li>Place chocolate in a microwae-safe bowl. Heat for 1 minute, then stir and continue to heat and stir at 20 second intervals until chocolate is melted and smooth. Pour chocolate over the caramel layer and spread evenly to cover completely. Chill. Cut into 1 inch squares. These need to be small because they are so rich.</li>
