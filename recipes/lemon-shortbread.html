<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon lemon extract</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, room temperature</li>
</ul>

    <li>In a medium bowl, mix butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer until combined. Blend in lemon zest, lemon extract, and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Stir flour and salt into butter mixture. Transfer mixture to waxed paper or plastic wrap. Roll into a log (for slicing cookies) or shape into a disk (for using cutters); wrap dough and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface until 1/4 inch thick. Cut out cookies using a 2-inch round cutter and place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. (Or slice cookies and arrange on baking sheets). Gather and reroll dough scraps.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until edges are pale golden, but not browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand on baking sheet 2 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool completely.</li>
